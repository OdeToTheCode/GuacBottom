        <h2>GuacBottom Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>The purpose of GuacBottom is to provide busy coders like ourselves a website that gives healthy recipe options with a list of ingredients, directions for preparation, and nutritional information for all ingredients. Here at Guacbottom we realize how important it is to keep on track, and your time as a coder is extremely valuable. What separates GuacBottom from other recipe websites is that we cut through all the nonsense they list, so busy coders can quickly find the information needed to prepare quick and healthy meal options so they can get back to coding and be productive web developers.</p>

        <h2>About GuacBottom</h2>
        <p>GuacBottom was developed by four coding students, Maxwell Walters, Erik Neafus, Jacob Figueroa, and Christopher Clark at the University of Minnesota bootcamp cohort. This website provides healthy recipe resources to meet the needs of hungry coders who have little time outside of class to provide nutritional and substantial meals to fuel their creative process. As a user you can find recipes from across the internet and copy and paste those links into GuacBottom to create a clean and easy to read repository of your favorite recipes with all the essential information needed, without all the clutter, to create delicious and healthy meals in a timely manner.
