# Recipe Web Site

## Group Project Goal:

The Goal of this project is to work with a group of other developers to create a website which will utilize a different websites API to pull data from, then populates that data into our projects website. The website will also use another new technology, have at least 2 HTML pages with semantically correct HTML, use Bootstrap along with custom CSS and be responsive at a mobile and desktop breakpoint.   This website will run in the browser and will dynamically update the HTML and CSS throught JavaScript.
