# GuacBottom Recipe Emporium Website:

## Group Project Goal:

The Goal of this project is to work with a group of other developers to create a website which will utilize a different website's API to pull data from, then populate that data into our project's website. This website will also use another new technology, have at least 2 HTML pages with semantically correct HTML, create a form where the user provides some information that gets stored in LocalStorage, use Bootstrap along with custom CSS and be responsive at a mobile and desktop breakpoint. In addition, this website will run in the browser and will dynamically update the HTML and CSS through JavaScript powered by jQuery.
